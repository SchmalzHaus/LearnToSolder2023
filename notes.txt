LearnToSolder 2018 Notes file

* Use PIC12F1572-I/SN microcontroller (8-pin SOIC SMT part)
* Use 2 push button switches as input
* Can push button switches do wakeup? Or is a SPDT slide switch needed? Looks like the two push buttons can be used to wake up the processor.
* How many LEDs can be chaliplexed? Wikipedia says up to 12 with 4 I/Os.
* Can we use RGB leds? (four pins)
  * Problem - their pins are very close together
* How about 8 LEDs (two each red, green, yellow, blue)?
* Need to add pads for programming/debugging - use 3D printed jig with pogo pins? How about 'snap-on' or 'clip on' to edge of board?

* What is best maximum board size?
  Seeed will do 100mm x 100mm, qt 10 for $4.41. But if qty goes up, price goes up. Order lots of 10s? Does that just increase shipping?
